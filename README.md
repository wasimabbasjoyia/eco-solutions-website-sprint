* **Google Fonts:** `Open Sans` (body) and `Roboto Slab` (headings) for a professional typographic scheme.

## 5. Setup and Installation

To get a local copy of this project up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

You need a modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) to view the project. No special server setup is required for basic local viewing.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/wasimabbasjoyia/eco-solutions-website-sprint.git](https://github.com/wasimabbasjoyia/eco-solutions-website-sprint.git)
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd eco-solutions-website-sprint
    ```
3.  **Open `index.html`:**
    Simply open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser.

    Alternatively, if you have a local development server set up (like the "Live Server" extension for VS Code), you can serve the directory to get live reloading and a proper local URL.

## 6. Project Structure

The project has a straightforward and organized file structure:

```
eco-solutions-website-sprint/
├── index.html          # Main HTML file for the website
├── style.css           # All CSS rules, including variables and responsive styles
├── script.js           # All JavaScript for interactivity and client-side validation
└── docs/               # Directory for documentation, screenshots, and assets
    └── logo_concept_1.png # Logo image used in README
└── README.md           # This file
```

## 7. Development Progress

This project was developed efficiently over a three-day sprint, covering all essential front-end aspects:

* **HTML Structure:** Established a robust and semantic HTML foundation for all key sections including header, hero, about, services, testimonials, contact form, and footer.
* **CSS Styling:** Implemented a professional and consistent design using a well-defined CSS architecture. This included:
    * **CSS Variables:** For easy theme management (colors, fonts, spacing).
    * **Responsive Layouts:** Utilized Flexbox and CSS Grid for adaptable designs across various screen sizes (mobile-first approach).
    * **Component Styling:** Detailed styling for navigation, buttons, service cards, testimonials, and the contact form elements.
* **JavaScript Interactivity:** Integrated essential JavaScript functionalities for an enhanced user experience:
    * **Mobile Navigation Toggle:** For a responsive hamburger menu.
    * **Smooth Scrolling:** For seamless navigation between page sections.
    * **Active Link Highlighting:** Using `IntersectionObserver` to indicate the current section in the navigation.
    * **Client-Side Form Validation:** Provides immediate feedback for the contact form, improving user interaction.

## 8. Next Steps & Future Enhancements

The website is now fully functional, but there are always ways to improve and expand a project.

* **Server-Side Form Handling:** Implement a backend (e.g., using Node.js, Python/Flask, PHP) to actually process and store contact form submissions securely.
* **Enhanced Accessibility (A11y):** Conduct a deeper accessibility audit, adding ARIA attributes where appropriate, refining keyboard navigation, and ensuring sufficient color contrast.
* **Performance Optimization:**
    * **Image Compression:** Use tools like TinyPNG or Squoosh.app to further optimize all image assets for faster loading.
    * **Lazy Loading:** Implement `loading="lazy"` on `<img>` tags for images below the fold.
    * **Code Minification:** Minify `style.css` and `script.js` for production deployment.
* **Cross-Browser Compatibility:** Thoroughly test across a wider range of browsers and devices (real devices, not just emulators).
* **SEO Optimization:** Add a `<meta name="description">`, explore structured data (Schema.org), and consider integrating Google Analytics.
* **Interactive Elements:** Potentially add subtle animations or transitions for elements entering the viewport (e.g., using libraries like AOS).
* **Dedicated 404 Page:** Create a custom error page for broken links.
